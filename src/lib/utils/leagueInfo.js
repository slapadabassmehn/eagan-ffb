After seeing the throb of the LoS in our inaugural year, Charlie has competed for the Schwanz every year since. He had an excellent initial draft, nailing it with: Davante Adams, Dalvin Cook, and Ekeler. His lack of QB and drafting Derrious not-Guice probably hindered his initial year. But since then, bro has nailed his rookie drafts: Lamb, Lawrence, Daniels, Achane, Collins, Love – with the former four being his 1st rounders, going to prove that you can lose the league in the draft. Meaning that he didn’t lose the league because he draft so well, see?<br><br> Now, let’s talk about his downfall. Two big trades (which I might add have been ¼ of his trades, so a large amount) have led to his aging team hanging on by a thread: trading away Lamb (for Alcoholic Addisen and Rent-a-Zeke Pollard) and Nico Collins (for Sony Michel). To be fair, the latter was before a Collins explosion. But Charlie needs to trust himself and his draft expertise so he doesn’t wallow in 5th place purgatory for the foreseeable future.<br><br> Charlie, over the last five years has had the strongest team with his potential points leading the league at <b>10198.16</b>, which is nearly 200 more than Tim almost 400 more than the 3rd place team. Unfortunately, a lot of that was unrealized potential – his rate of 83.31% puts him less than one percentage point higher than the 10th place team.<br><br>Charlie is his own worst enemy, and his Bestest Mensch. Trust himself in the draft, but maybe take a page out of the commish’s book and maximize his potential.",

He is also the <b>most winningest team</b> with 5 Championships – 4 from the standard days and 1 from dynasty, respectfully. He also is the only manager to win two times in a row, unfortunately he was the last int he standard and first in the dynasty, so Lindberg’s retirement is still safe.<br><br>After competing for three years, he blew up his team in 2022, taking the Load that year, but quickly rising to relevance with some savvy trades in the off season. 2024 may be the realization of one of the quickest rebuilds in history.<br><br>Speaking of trades, John has accounted for almost 15% (35 total) of all the league’s trades with the next being Gorman with 27. To be perfectly frank, he doesn’t lose many trades. The biggest ones he probably lost involved Tyreek Hill… twice. Besides that, he doesn’t lose, or destroys in the trades. This accounts for his quick turnaround. He is also the waiver wire king, finding diamonds in the rough – Kenyan Drake and Breshad Perriman come to mind as key contributors to his championship run.<br><br>His drafts have been decent, usually not losing value with his first rounders, and finding some true values in the later rounds: Brian Robinson, Jerome Ford, Darnell Mooney. His drafts have at least not busted enough to hamstring the rebuild attempts.<br><br> Now, where he struggles is implementing those nice transactions into maximizing points. He is in the bottom half of roster IQ at 82.40%. Which is only .7% more than perennial LoS and now defunct manager, Selby. Me thinks, perhaps a little more research into the week in and week out of his roster might prove more fruitful, perhaps with a bye or two in the coming years.<br><br>With that being said, the league would not be what it is without him. He is constantly engaged, bringing new and fruitful ideas to the forefront. Always responding to trades, and active. Maybe if the rest of you would trade as often as he does, you might be in line for a Schwanz as well.",

        "bio": "The march towards his rightful retirement has been a struggle for his name sake. Since making the playoffs in the first year (via a technicality, and honorable acceptance of 2024’s champion), Lindberg has been on the struggle bus, racking up 5 of the top 10 lowest week totals and three of the lowest yearly totals.<br><br>Now, let’s try not to rag too hard on the Studberg, he is, afterall, a dynasty OG – and he has some good qualities too. He was instrumental in initiating the first amendment, followed up by more instrumentalness by setting the precedent of not having to receive punishments. He also sets his line up every week. Now, it’s not all doom and gloom, while hitting or missing on trades, they haven’t necessarily kept him from competing. But his drafts could use a bit of research/luck. In the initial rookie draft, he traded away his 1st for Leonard Fournette, followed up with two duds in Pitts and Rondale Moore, followed by Breece (who promptly destroyed his knee) and Skyy Moore. These bad picks and bad luck are probably the major reason for his suffering. But, on the flip side, he hits pretty well for non-1st rounders: Rashee Rice (2.01), Tank Dell (3.01), George Pickens (2.01), Antonio Gibson (2.07) – in fact, the only year he didn’t hit with a later round pick was 2021.<br><br>Things are looking up for Lindberg’s future. While still not the behemoth he could have been, he is in the playoff hunt for 2024 after making some savvy trades, and drafting safely. His 82.45% manager IQ is respectable. His waiver activity could use a bump and could aid in building a more secure roster.<br><br>If he can avoid total busts in his early round picks, and continue hitting on later picks, he might be strongly competing for his retirement faster than anticipated.",

He has cautiously rebuilt his team in attempts to rub the stain of 2nd place off his record with a 2025 Schwanz run.<br><br>Gorman doesn’t shy away from not cutting lose with his team. He is (you guessed it), 2nd in waiver moves, and 2nd in trades. He also is pretty communist whilst trading, completing trades with half the league. Now, while we like Gorman for his engagement, we <b>love</b> him for his manager IQ, meaning it’s not great. The only non-defunct manager he outranks is Reno by .09%. Maybe a little more time crunching fantasy football and not numbers would result in a ‘ship or two for him.<br><br>Gorman is a pretty decent drafter. He’s like a coked up Lindberg sprinkled with a little Anders. His only true bust was Isaiah Spiller in 2022. One could argue Burrow in 2020, with Higgins, Pittman, and Aiyuk still on the board, but Burrow is hardly a bust – maybe a missed opportunity. Anyway, he has some good hits with Kincaid, Shakir, Stevenson, Khalil Herbert, Jalen Hurts, (maybe Bibgsy and Spears), in the later rounds.<br><br> Gorman is the only other repeat champion dating back to the inception of the league in 2009, granted those were both in re-draft. He’s also the most winningest manager… in redraft. The magic seemed to be lost when we transitioned ;). As Gorman transitions his team from rebuilding to contender, he’d do well to behave like this is re-draft and capture some of the magic that made him prolific in his early fantasy football years.",

        "bio": "Ah, our first orphan team take-over. Garrett, our first commissioner, mastermind behind the re-draft league, left his team high and dry in our first year, and he was promptly replaced by Tyler Broberg, a more attentive, loving, and wiley manager than Garrett could have ever hoped to be. After taking over for the 2020 season, Tyler went HAM and immediately began his rebuild, accepting the LoS that year. He proceeded to lay the blueprint for a slow and steady rebuild process. Since receiving the Load, he has steadily gained 2 wins per year, making the playoffs in 2023. Now, it might not have been as sexy as John’s immediate turn around, but this might be the blueprint for sustained success and a true shot at LRP. Bro has the WR4, WR6, WR11, and WR17, just an insane group of young studs. All done through the draft. No falling into it, no trade manipulation (unless you count using his brother as a lackey to acquire picks).<br><br>Speaking of drafts, Tyler might have the most successful drafts of all time. As we know, you can lose a league, or significantly set yourself back years by drafting poorly. Not only does he rarely bust, but he hit just about every single 1st rounder: Najee Harris, Drake London,Ja’marr  Chase, Garrett Wilson, JK Dobbins, Devonta Smith, Bryce Young. One could argue that Dobbins was/is a bust, but before the injury he was definitely an asset, and the jury is still our on Bryce. He has also hit on a few later picks: Pacheco, Pierce, Reed, Doubs.<br><br>The point is, that core of WRs will keep him in contention for the next 6 years. If he can build a solid RB troupe to be the supporting cast to his potentially behemoth of a team, he may be the first team to but the LRP in serious jeopardy.",

While not as prolific as Mr. Brobergs, they have all been major pieces in building a competitive team.

While this most certainly strengthened his team into a contender, his ‘ship window has shrunk, and he will need near peak seasons from his aging vets to put some pressure on the current power rank leaders. That being said for the first 3-4 years, we have been pretty consistent in terms of who was competing, Reno is part of the new guard, fresh blood, hankering for a shot at the Schwanz. As established vets age out, as long as Reno raises his manager IQ, we could see him lead the charge of the new contenders – much like the Avengers.

He then has been able to pair that with Bijan and JTT, creating one of the most powerful RB rooms in the league – we’re talking three of the top five RBs. To put that in perspective, John has the second best RB room, and he’s sitting with Breece, Rachaad White, and Javonte Williams: RB2, RB15, and RB23, respectively.  He’s a bit thin and aging at WR position, but riding Mike Evans and DeAndre Hopkins into the dirt isn’t an awful strategy if the team is buoyed by three stallions. But if he truly wants to compete, strengthening his WR is a good place to start.<br><br> 2024 is ripe for the picking with the changing of the guard in full swing, leaving an opportunity for a mega team to come in and take what is rightfully Lindbergs.
