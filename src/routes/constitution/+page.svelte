<ul>
<li><p>Sleeper will be designated application </p>
</li>
<li><p>12 Teams </p>
</li>
<li><p>No Divisions, all teams compete against each other in the Schwanz Bowl </p>
</li>
<li><p>Roster sizes: 26 (28 if 10 teams) at the start of the regular season until rookie draft. Roster will expand at rookie draft through the regular season. You will need to make your cuts by the last preseason game to bring back to 26. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you do not cut your players, the commish will do so in a timely manner. Once the cuts happen there is no “going back”. It’s your team. Take responsibility.   </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Keeping kickers for the moment. I prefer not to, but I need a second! </p>
</li>
<li><p>IR – 3 IR spots (unless pandemic)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Taxi Squad – Yes </p>
<ul>
<li>Players with less than two years experience may be placed on the taxi squad.  </li>
<li>You may “edit” the TS throughout the off season.  </li>
<li>Taxi squad locks when the season begins. Meaning no more adding players.   </li>

</li>
<li><p>Schedule will randomize every year </p>

<li><p>Starting lineups to include – 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 WR/TE, 1 Flex, 1 Defense, 1 Kicker :( </p>
</li>
<li><p>LoS recipient will be required to compete in the following events: 40 yd dash, vertical jump, bench press (135 lbs), 20 yd shuttle, broad jump. These must be completed, results sent to commish, and videoed before the draft.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are no consequences for “not fulfilling” your punishment – be that doubling up, LoS, shotgun bet. It is gentleman&#39;s honor. The league reserves the right to ridicule and call you out, there will be no enforcement of punishments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>League Reset  </p>
<ul>
<li>Once a repeat champ has been named, the league will reset.  </li>
<li>Payments will roll over  </li>
<li>If an owner decides to jump ship, they will be refunded their funds.  </li>
<li>Draft order will be determined by the last three years of VPs. e.g if you have scored the most VPs you get first pick where you want to draft, be that pick 1 or pick 12. This will be determined a month or so before the “initial” draft.  </li>
<li>Initial draft will be snake order and include both rookies and veterans.</li>

</li>
<li><p>$0 claims allowed </p>
</li>
<li><p>Continuous waivers - meaning all players are on waivers until 11 AM CST. This will help everyone get a chance at Chubb hunting. </p>
</li>

<p>It is your responsibility to trim your roster. If you do not, the commish will do it for you. Sleeper has odd IR designations. You can keep a player on there until they are no longer IR eligible. They will count as a roster spot before each trim/expansion.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="rookie-fa-draft">Rookie/FA Draft</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Subsequent rookie drafts will take place after NFL draft and before NFL Preseason </p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Each round is linear, not snake. After 12th pick of each round, next pick goes back to the first team (same as NFL draft) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="team-ownership">Team ownership</h1>
<p>(If you’re responsible, don’t worry about this mumbo jumbo. I literally copied and tweaked from some other league guide.) </p>
<ul>
<li>If an owner leaves the league for any reason, his dues are forfeit to the prize pool and he will have no claim to them in any way. This includes if he finds a replacement owner, unless the replacement owner is willing to reimburse him and pay the dues required to join the league.   </li>
<li>If an owner cannot reasonably meet the dues deadline, they must notify the Commissioner and make alternate arrangements. Failure to do so will result in the forfeiture of their team for the current season and seeking a replacement owner.    </li>
<li>If an owner forfeits his team, a replacement will be found as soon as possible to replace that owner for continuity. </li>
</ul>
<p>An owner may retire from the league in good standing. Retirement must be announced before the conclusion of Week 17 of the NFL season to retire in good standing. Upon announcement of an owner’s retirement, a replacement owner will be sought and they will be responsible for the upcoming season’s league fee if it has not already been paid by the retiring owner. Once an owner announces their retirement, they may not make any trades for the remainder of the season. A retirement announcement is irrevocable, but an owner who retires in good standing may be considered for reinstatement to the league after an absence of at least one full season.   </p>
<p>Aside from retirement, orphan teams can be created through the following circumstances: </p>
<ul>
<li>Quitting owner: If an owner publicly declares that they are quitting the league on the league site or chat, the team is immediately classified as an orphan team and the Commissioner will assume control of the team until a replacement owner is found. Public, written “I quit” declarations are permanent and irrevocable; quitting owners are permanently barred from seeking reinstatement to the league.   </li>
<li>Abandoning owner: A team is considered abandoned during the season if an owner fails to set a lineup for two consecutive weeks.​     </li>
</ul>
<p>○ If you can’t set your lineup, let commissioner know and they will set it for you. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Removal of an owner for failure to pay league fees by one month before the NFL draft. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Removal of an owner for cheating or anti-competitive conduct </p>
</li>
<li><p>Removal of an owner or multiple owners for collusion between teams </p>
</li>
<li><p>Removal of an owner or owners for offering and/or accepting bribes (i.e. real-life money or any other real-life consideration) as an incentive to complete league trades, league transactions or influence league activity of any kind.   </p>
</li>
<li><p>Removal of an owner for conduct or transactions detrimental to the league. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Removal of an owner for failing to maintain the minimum or maximum roster size.. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Removal of an owner for repeated failure to adhere to league rules or abide by Commissioner rulings. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Removal of an owner for repeated failure to communicate with owners or the Commissioner in a mature or respectful manner. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a team is orphaned during the season, the Commissioner will set that team’s roster for the remainder of that season. The commissioner will play the team to the best of his ability using trades, the waiver wire, etc. at his disposal to field a competitive team and set the future owner up for success. The stated preference is that the Commissioner setting the orphan team’s roster not be scheduled to play that orphan team during the season. In the event the Commissioner’s team does play the orphan team during the season, another league member shall set the orphan team’s lineup for that game.<br>Payouts won by a team orphaned during a regular season will be put into the following year’s pool to be distributed as extra prize winnings.   </p>
<h1 id="changing-league-rules-commissioner-duties">Changing League Rules/Commissioner Duties</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Commissioner has ultimate authority.</p>
<p>○ Every effort will be made to include a vote and viewpoints. But as is common in the league, not many voices speak up. So at the end of the day, almost every decision is the Commissioners.</p>
<p>○ It is each party&#39;s responsibility to be familiar with the rules and regulations. Ignorance is not a good enough reason to undo decisions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Proposed rules or scoring changes must be communicated to all owners. This may be achieved via group chat. </p>
</li>
<li><p>For binary votes: Simple majority in favor,  change will result in a successful. </p>
<p>○ Majority is a loose term wherein some members choose not to participate. These non-votes will count as neither for nor against.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Changes will be implemented in the following league year unless otherwise specified.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Roster sizes are your responsibility to be aware of and make changes to. The commish reserves the right to trim your roster down as needed. Every effort will be made to trim the “least valuable” players.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="collusion-dumping-tanking">Collusion/Dumping/Tanking</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Don’t be a dick. We all know what you’re doing. If you’re repeatedly accused of any such negativity, it may result in expulsion from the league </p>
</li>
<li><p>Yearly dues and other payments will not be reimbursed if you caught and kicked out. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="amendments">Amendments</h1>
<p>First Amendment - Baby Got Back aka Double Up<br>When an opponent has more than doubled up your score, they get to choose a double shot for you to take. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>A simple double up of the score does not warrant implementation of this punishment. E.g. 100-50. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The score must be more than double. E.g. 100.01-50 </p>
</li>
<li><p>May be two single shots or one double shot, to be determined by the winner. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Said loser will video record the doubleshot and post in the chat or send to commissioner to post on the website before the Monday night game of the following week. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Amendment will be implemented starting week 6 in the year of our Lord 2019. </p>
